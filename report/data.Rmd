#### **Table 0 - ISO Country Codes**

Source:

IBAN.com is an authorized VocaLink Distributor: <https://www.iban.com/country-codes>
    
The table `iso_country_codes` contains the complete list of country names with their respective number and letter codes, to ease the identification of each country on the subsequent tables that form part of this analysis. In addition, the names of the countries described in this table will serve as the basis for all the others data sets to ensure that every country is labeled the same across all tables.

The columns were renamed to fit the information they were providing. The information related to the numerical codes in this table was deleted as we decided that we were going to use the ISO code because the other tables were also using it and thus did not need a second way of identifying each country.

We noticed that Kosovo (XKX) and Channel Islands(CHI) were lacking information not only in this table but also in all of the others and thus are not considered on the scope of this analysis. We can see in tables 3, 4 and 5 that CHI does not contain values across all the years. On the other hand, XKX only has partial information in table 4 (2000 to 2005) and 5 (2006 to 2016) and none in table 3.

#### **Table 1 - Global Mortality Rate - Air Pollution**

The table `mortality rate` contains the overall rate of deaths from various diseases worldwide, where the main risk factor was ambient particulate matter pollution between 1990 and 2019. It considers all ages and both sexes. There are 19 different diseases taken into account and the metric used is a rate per 100k deaths.

In this table, some columns containing numeric values were seen as characters so they had to be converted to numeric in order to be worked on. Then, the values were rounded, the columns renamed and the table reshaped for clarity purposes.

We also created a table containing the five most deadly diseases across all years. The table will help our analysis later on this report.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mortality_rate <- read.csv(here::here("data/mortality_rate.csv"), header = TRUE, dec = ".")
mortality_rate[,8:11] <- sapply(mortality_rate[,c(8:11)], as.numeric)

mortality <- mortality_rate_wider%>%
                    mutate(Total = select(., '1990':'2019') %>% 
                    rowSums(na.rm = TRUE))%>%
                    relocate(Total, .before = '1990')%>%

                     "Lower respiratory infections"),]
                
kable(mortality[1:5,1:16], caption = "Identifying the deadliest diseases caused by air pollutants (E.g. 1990-1998)")  %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")
```


#### **Table 2 - Mortality Rate by Country - Air Pollution**

Source:

Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network. Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) Results. Seattle, United States: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 2020. Available from: <http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool>

The table `mortality rate per country` contains the overall rate of deaths from various diseases per country, where the main risk factor was ambient particulate matter pollution, between 1990 and 2019. It considers all ages and both sexes. There are 19 different diseases taken into account and the metric used is a rate per 100k deaths. 


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mortality_rate_country <- read.csv(here::here("data/mortality_rate_countries.csv"), header = TRUE)
mortality_rate_country <- select(mortality_rate_country, location, cause, year, val)

kable(mortality_rate_country[1:5, ],caption = "Examples from the original table (select only location, cause, year, and val)") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")

```

First, We would like to assign ISO country codes into the `mortality_rate_country` table, to make sure that we will be analyzing the same countries in every table, so we joined the table with the `iso_country_codes` table by country name.

Then, we checked for missing or mismatching values by creating a sub-table and found out that 27 countries from `mortality_rate_country` did not match the `iso_country_codes from`.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

checkna <- mortality_rate_country %>% select(location) %>%
                                      unique() %>%
                                      left_join(iso_country_codes,
                                      by = c("location" = "Country.Name"))
checkna <- checkna[is.na(checkna[,c("Country.Code3")]),]
kable(checkna[1:5, ], caption = sprintf("Examples of countries that cannot be found in the iso_country_codes table (%.0f countries in total)",length(checkna$location)))  %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")

```
<br/> We found out that the vast majority of N/A values were caused by country names written differently.

e.g. In the `mortality_rate_country` table RUS is written "Russian Federation" but in the `iso_country_codes` table, RUS is written "Russian Federation (the)".

There was also an issue related to a font error where CIV (Côte d'Ivoire) in the `iso_country_codes` was written as "CÃ´te d'Ivoire" in `mortality_rate_country`.

To fix these issues, we created a sub-table to match the countries that were creating N/A values with their proper ISO codes. Afterward, we used this sub-table to assign the correct ISO codes to the countries in the `mortality_rate_country` table.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

exception_table_countryname <- data.frame(
  iso_name=c("Côte d'Ivoire", "Russian Federation (the)", "Dominican Republic (the)", 
             "Republic of North Macedonia", "Philippines (the)", 
             "Lao People's Democratic Republic (the)", "Palestine, State of",
             "Netherlands (the)", "Moldova (the Republic of)", "Marshall Islands (the)",
             "United States of America (the)", "Congo (the)", "Korea (the Republic of)",
             "Comoros (the)", "Tanzania, United Republic of", "United Arab Emirates (the)",
             "Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of)", 
             "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)",
             "Gambia (the)", "Bahamas (the)", "Central African Republic (the)",
             "Congo (the Democratic Republic of the)", "Cook Islands (the)",
             "Sudan (the)", "Niger (the)", "Northern Mariana Islands (the)",
             "Virgin Islands (U.S.)"),
  na_name=c("CÃ´te d'Ivoire","Russian Federation", "Dominican Republic", 
            "North Macedonia", "Philippines",
            "Lao People's Democratic Republic", "Palestine",
            "Netherlands", "Republic of Moldova", "Marshall Islands",
            "United States of America", "Congo", "Republic of Korea",
            "Comoros", "United Republic of Tanzania", "United Arab Emirates",
            "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", 
            "United Kingdom", 
            "Gambia", "Bahamas", "Central African Republic", 
            "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Cook Islands", 
            "Sudan", "Niger", "Northern Mariana Islands",
             "United States Virgin Islands"))
exception_table_countryname <- left_join(exception_table_countryname, iso_country_codes, by = c("iso_name" = "Country.Name"))

mortality_rate_country <- left_join(mortality_rate_country, exception_table_countryname, by = c("location" = "na_name"))

#replace na_name to the main table
ix_not_na <- !is.na(mortality_rate_country$iso_name)
mortality_rate_country$location[ix_not_na] <- mortality_rate_country$iso_name[ix_not_na]

mortality_rate_country <- mortality_rate_country %>% 
                          select(location, cause, year, val)%>%
                          left_join(iso_country_codes,
                                    by=c("location" = "Country.Name"))%>%
                          select(location, Country.Code3, cause, year, val)
      
#check to ensure that there is no NA
recheckna <- is.na(mortality_rate_country$Country.Code3)
# sum(recheckna) #0 = no NA found

```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kable(exception_table_countryname[1:5, ], caption = "Examples from the exception table created for fixing the naming issues")  %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")

```
<br/>

Once the ISO codes were correctly assigned, we renamed the columns and restructured the table to have each disease in a column. Then, we created the 'Total' column which shows the total number of deaths from every disease per country, per year.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#create variables by cause and total column
mortality_rate_country_wide <- mortality_rate_country %>% 
                                group_by(year, location) %>%
                                mutate(Total = sum(val)) %>%
                                pivot_wider(names_from = cause, 
                                           values_from = val)
kable(mortality_rate_country_wide[1:5,1:11],caption = "Examples from the final output for mortality rate by country") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered")

```

#### **Table 3 - Pollutant PM2.5**

Source:

[\<https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?dsid=2&series=EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3\>](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?dsid=2&series=EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3){.uri}

The table `Airpol` shows the mean annual exposure of particulate matter2.5 (PM2.5) per country between 1990 and 2017. PM2.5 are particles with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 microns which means particles that are smaller than 0,0025 millimeters. Air pollution is measured in micrograms per cubic meter.

First, we removed the empty columns or the ones with information that are not relevant for our analysis. Afterward, some columns were containing numeric values that were seen as characters, so we changed them back to numeric values so we could work on them. Values were also rounded for clarity purposes.

When joining `Airpol` and `iso_country_codes`, we noticed that the only missing countries in `Airpol` are Kosovo(XKX) and the Channel Islands(CHI), and thus we will not consider them in the analysis so we excluded them from this table.

We also discovered that 55 countries were missing values for the years 1990 to 2017, so we decided not to include them in the final `Airpol` table. We created a sub-table called `missing_data_airpol` containing all missing countries.

Some countries will also display N/A values when joining them with other tables (4 and 5). We created another sub-table called `airpol.missing.countries` which contains the list of the 14 countries that will be missing.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#### **Table 4 - GDP - Factor of Air Pollution**

Source:

International Comparison Program, World Bank \| World Development Indicators database, World Bank \| Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme.

<https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD>

The table `gdp` contains the GDP per capita per country based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates, the information of the table runs from 1990 to 2020. Indicator Code: *NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD* Indicator Name: *GDP per capita, PPP (current international \$)*

First, we deleted the columns that were not relevant for our analysis and renamed them for clarity purposes.

We realized when joining `gdp` and `iso_country_codes` that the data set included locations that were not countries but continents or regions (e.g. "British Virgin Islands"). As our analysis for this table focuses on individual countries, we will not take these locations into account. We created a sub-table that contains a list of all these locations. Furthermore, we also removed Kosovo (XKX) and Channel Islands (CHI) for the reasons we mentioned earlier.

Just like the previous table, we found that several countries (52) had missing values. For that reason, we decided to not consider them in the final table for GDP. We created a sub-table containing the countries that were lacking values `missing_data_gdp`. There are also countries that will display N/A values when joining them with other tables (3 and 5), so we created a sub-table called `gdp.missing.countries` which contain the list of the 11 countries that will be missing.

Source:

World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.
    
  <https://databank.worldbank.org/source/jobs/Type/TABLE/preview/on>

The table `agriculture` shows the value added by the agricultural sector to the GDP for each country between 1990 and 2016. The metric used is a percentage of the GDP.

We started by deleting empty columns, renaming them, and transforming characters' values into numeric ones when needed.

Just like the other tables, we will not consider Kosovo (XKX) and Channel Islands (CHI) and exclude them from this table.

Just like the previous tables, we found that several countries (52) had missing values. For that reason, we decided to not consider them in the final table for `agriculture`. We created a sub-table containing the countries that were lacking values `missing_data_agri`. There are also countries (11) displaying N/A values when joining them with other tables (3 and 4), so we created a sub-table called `agri.missing.countries` to identify them.

The table `landlocked_countries` is a list of all countries that are considered landlocked as of July 2017. A country is considered landlocked if it is surrounded by at least one other country which means it has no direct access to any coastline which means no direct access to any oceans / seas. This table includes 5 partially recognized states.


We assigned ISO country codes into the`landlocked_countries` table and we found that there were 14 countries (out of 49 landlocked countries) whose names did not match with the ISO country names. We applied the same strategy we used in table 2: we created a sub_table to fix the mismatching issue and then replaced them in the `landlocked_countries` table.

After replacing the ISO-standard country names in the table, we found that there are still 7 countries that have no ISO country codes

#### **Table 7 - 19 - Air Quality Pollution Levels**

Source:

Air Quality Open Data Platform \| The World Air Quality Index project \| Worldwide COVID-19 dataset

<https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/verify/f042745e-a7a1-4c10-b98d-13c6b69bcc2d>

These tables contain information about the overall air quality in 380 cities worldwide from 2015 to 2020. The data set provides a wide variety of information such as min, max, etc. for each air pollutant species (PM2.5, PM10, etc.) as well as meteorological data (wind, temperature, ...). the years 2019 and 2020 are divided quarterly. PM2.5 and PM10 are measured in $\mu g/x^{3}$. O3, SO2, and NO2 are measured in ppm (parts per million).

First, we assigned numeric values when it was needed and restructured the table for clarity purposes.

There are 12 files for each quarter/semi-annual from 2015 to 2020, so we run a for loop and use the rbind function to aggregate the data from all sources into 1 table.

The original data sources reported daily air pollution data in cities around the world. However, our study focuses on air pollution at a national level, so we calculate average daily air pollution data for each country.

We stored the output in the `airquality_daily` table which contains 3 variables, data, country (Alpha-Code2), and Averagepm25. We then joined with the `iso_country_codes` table and added country names and Country.Code3, which is the 3 letters ISO Code, in the table.

We checked if Country.Code3 had any N/A and found that there were 1230 N/A, which were from only 1 country: Kosovo (XKX). Since Kosovo is not in the scope of our study, we removed Kosovo from the table. 

Subsequently, we converted the daily air pollution data to seasonality by averaging the air pollution data for each month.
